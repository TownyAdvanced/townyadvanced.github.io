			<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><code>using_economy: true</code> in your towny config.yml.</li>
					<li><code>war.enemy.allow_attacks: 'true'</code> in your towny config.yml</li>
					<li>War is only between nations.</li>
					<li>Towns not in a nation cannot go to war.</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>How Does Flag War Work?:</h4>
				Nation A decides that Nation B sucks. The King declares them enemies using the <code>/nation enemy add NationB</code> command.<br><br>
				
				The residents of NationA can now attack the towns of NationB. In order to attack, residents first need to obtain some fence posts so that they can raise their flag and dub the plots of NationB as their own.<br><br>

				The flag bearer is the player who will be placing the flag. When the plot has been won over, the plot will be claimed as part of the flagbearer’s town (so make sure they have extra plots available to claim).<br><br>
	
			<h4>Attacking:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>You cannot attack if you are a server OP.</li>			
					<li>You cannot attack a nation that is neutral.</li>
					<li>You cannot attack while being in a neutral nation.</li>
					<li>You can only attack the borders plots.</li>
					<li>You can only place flags on the surface.</li>
				</ul>
			
				You can also not attack a nation with less than <code>war.enemy.min_players_online_in_nation</code> players online and 
				the town you’re attacking must have more than <code>war.enemy.min_players_online_in_town</code> player online. 
				These same requirements are in place for you as well, so you must have the minimum in both cases. 
				This is so that the target can retaliate as well as know what’s going on.<br><br>
				
				Attacking a nation will cause you to become their enemies. 
				This allows for the target to retaliate immediately without waiting for the target’s king or his assistants to come online.<br><br>

				Towny will automatically place a block of wool for the flag, as well as a light source on top. 
				In the sky you will notice a large beacon so that the defenders know where to go. 
				The wool will animate from green to red as time progresses. 
				After the wool has gone red, the attacker will have held out long enough that they win the area.<br><br>
				
			<h4>Defending:</h4>
				Once an attack has started. Teleport to the town under attack. Scan the sky for the beacon and make your way to it.
				The flag will be on the surface. Kill your enemies and make your way to their flag. Destroy the cloth part of the flag to cancel the attack.<br><br>
				
			<h4>Economic Costs:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Attacking does have a cost. Whenever a player places a flag, he or she is charged. The player is also checked if they can afford the repercussions of a successful or failed attack.</li>
					<li>Whenever a Defender breaks the flag, the Attacker is forced to pay a fee.</li>
					<li>If an attack is successful, there will be a charge depending on the situation.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First, there are different charges for both Homeblocks and normal plots.
						<li>Second, the charge will be either a pilllage fee where the Defending Town pays the Flagbearer, or it will be a rebuilding cost where the Flagbearer must pay the Town under attack. This offers a couple of diffrent modes of play.
					</ul>
				</ul>
			<h4>Further Notes:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>While the flag is under dispute, block permissions are changed. However, depending on the server setup, you might not gain full destruction capabilities until after the plot has been won.</li>
				</ul>
