			<center><h5>Introduction/Game-play:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				The new Event War is a hyper-configurable system supporting 6 basic war types:
				<div style="padding:10px;">
					<ul>
						<li>Riot - One town fighting amongst itself. Players side with the city or the rioters via team selection.</li> 
						<li>Town vs Town - Two towns fight against each other.</li>
						<li>Civil War - One nation fighting amongst itself. Towns side with the capital or the rebels via team selection.</li>
						<li>Nation vs Nation - Two nations fight against each other.</li>
						<li>Alliance vs Alliance - Two nations fight against each other, with both nations' allies joining the fight.</li>
						<li>World War - All nations with enemies will be thrown into war. Similar to the old EventWar.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				Wars are begun by an admin using <code>/ta war {wartype} ...</code> or via town-purchased Declaration of War books.<br><br>
				Declarations of War are purchased via Tokens using <code>/town redeem {wartype}</code>.<br><br>
				Tokens are earned by every non-neutral town each Towny newday. If a town is part of a nation that nation must not be neutral either. 
				Towns with an active war will also not receive war tokens.<br><br>
				EventWars can be configured to be just a simple game of PVP with no lasting consequences but hurt pride, or it can be configured to involve
				devastating griefing, and conquering of towns and nations. That's all up to the server.<br><br>
				
				<center><strong>You can see how your server is configured using the '/eventwar guide' command.</strong></center>
			</div> 
			<hr>
			<center><h5>Hyper-Configurable:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				Each war type has the following configurable settings:
				<div style="padding:10px;">
					<ul>
						<li>Token Cost - How many tokens does a Declaration of War of this type cost. </li>
						<li>Base Spoils - How much money is put up for grabs to be won.</li>
						<li>Cooldown Time - How much time must pass since the towns' last war (of any type) before they can take part in a war of this type.</li>
						<li>Max Time Duration - An optional maximum duration for a war, in case no other win-conditions are met.</li>
						<li>Surrender Allowed - Is surrendering allowed?</li>
						<li>Startup Delay - How much time before a war is begun, does the action start, for a war of this type.</li>
						<li>TownBlock HP - Whether a war of this type uses the TownBlock HP system. [Not applicable to Riot wars.]</li>
						<li>TownBlock Switch Towns - Whether a war of this type has TownBlocks that are dropped to 0HP switch to the conquering Towns. [Not applicable to Riot and Civil wars.]</li>
						<li>TownBlock Single Use - When TownBlock-Switch-Towns is true, determines whether a war of this type has TownBlocks which resurrect after a configurable amount of time, so that they can be re-conquered.. [Not applicable to Riot and Civil wars.]</li>
						<li>Resident Lives - How many lives does a resident get at the start of the war.</li>
						<li>Mayor Lives - How many lives does a mayor get at the start of the war.</li>
						<li>Mayor Death - If a mayor runs out of lives, does that remove their town from the war.</li>
						<li>Town Conquering - Does a war result in the winning side conquering the losing side. The outcome is different for each war type:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Riot - If rioters win, their highest scorer will become the new mayor.</li>
							<li>Town vs Town - The losing town will be merged into the winning town.</li>
							<li>Civil War - If the rebels win, the highest scorer will become the new capital of the nation.</li>
							<li>Nation vs Nation - Towns which are knocked out of the war will join the conquering nation.</li>
							<li>Alliance vs Alliance - Towns which are knocked out of the war will join the conquering nation.</li>
							<li>World War - Towns which are knocked out of the war will join the conquering nation.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Build & Destroy Editable Materials - Decides whether a war will allow the build/destroy of the WarZone Block Protection's editable_materials list.</li>
						<li>Switch Use - Decides if switches are enabled for the given war type.</li>
						<li>Item Use - Decides if item_use is enabled for the given war type.</li>
						<li>Points Per Kill - Decides how many points are given per kill.</li>
						<li>Neutrality Allowed - Whether neutral towns/nations are able to bypass a war.</li>
						<li>Minimum Online - A minimum number of people required to be online for the war type to begin.</li>
						<li>Minimum Online Ignores Low Pop - Whether the min-online is disabled when dealing with a low-pop town or nation which has 100% of its resident online.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					 
				Fire, Explosions can also be forced on in war-stricken towns.<br><br>
				Explosions can be made to revert, allowing for explosive wall-smashing, jail-breaking action that repairs itself after 60 seconds.<br><br>
				Points townblocks won, towns removed, and nations removed are all configurable.
			</div>
			<hr>
			<center><h5>Lore:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				Event War is heavy in lore. Books are generated and given to players when wars start, when they end, and on every hour. 
				They act as a permanent record for your players to store in their town libraries and museums.<br><br>
				
				Start-of-War books detail who is involved in the war, the rules by which they are fought and the consequences of victory and failure. 
				Your warconfig.yml's settings determine what goes into the books.<br><br>
				
				Hourly update books show players who is still in the fight and where the scores stand.<br><br>
				
				End-of-War books finalize the outcomes of the war, informing players who has survived, providing for a historical document for the ages.	 
			</div>
			<hr>
			<center><h5>Declaration of War Books:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				Declaration of War books are how players start wars. These books are purchased for Tokens using the <code>/town redeem</code> command.<br><br>
				By default riots DoW books cost the least, with the costs increasing as the scopes of the wars increase as well.<br><br>
				This means that riots and town wars will happen more often than civil wars, nation wars and world wars.<br><br>
				A town must be a part of a nation to redeem their tokens for civil war, nation war and world wars books.<br><br>
				An option exists in the warconfig: <code>are_declarations_of_war_usable_only_by_their_creators</code> which limits DoWs to only be used by the town which 
				purchased the book. When this is set to false, it is possible for towns to purchase DoW books and then give them to other towns. This means powerful
				nations can foment wars in other towns to destabilize them.<br><br>
				Declaration of War books are used by holding the book and using the <code>/declare war [wartype] [arg]</code> command, this is documented in the books themselves.
			</div>
			<hr>
			<center><h5>TownBlock HP Sytem:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				When a war type has the TownBlockHP system enabled all of the townblocks in each warring town are given an HP amount. 
				By default normal townblocks have 60 and homeblocks have 120 hp.<br><br>
				HP is lowered when attackers are stood in the townblock, and the attackers outnumber any allies of the town being attacked.<br><br>
				Optionally, townblock HPs can be healed when the allies outnumber the attackers.<br><br>
				Townblocks must be attacked from the edge of town, inwards towards the town's homeblock.<br><br>
				When townblocks are attacked, fireworks appear in the air above.<br><br>
				There is a configurable minimum height that players must be in the world to be considered an attacker.<br><br>
				If a jail plot has its HP dropped to zero, all of the prisoners of war will be unjailed in a prison break, 
				and the jail will no longer be usable for the duration of the war.<br><br>
				If the War allows it, TownBlocks can switch Towns when they are dropped to 0hp. See the /eventwar guide [wartype] to
				learn if this is enabled on your server for TownWar, NationWar, AllianceWar or WorldWar. It is not available for Riots or CivilWars.<br><br>
				If the War allows it and TownBlocks-can-switch-Towns is true, TownBlocks which have switched sides can be re-conquered after a configurable period of time. 
				See the /eventwar guide [wartype] to learn if this is enabled on your server for TownWar, NationWar, AllianceWar or WorldWar. It is not available for Riots or CivilWars.
			</div>
			<hr>
			<center><h5>Surrendering:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				When a war type allows surrendering, players are able to decide if they can give up.<br><br>
				For Riot, CivilWar, AllianceWar, and WorldWar types, the player uses /surrender.<br><br>
				Riots allow for anyone to surrender. CivilWar only allows a mayor to surrender their town. WorldWar only allows a king to surrender their nation.<br><br>
				If Riot wars have town conquering enabled, and the Mayor is the one surrendering, their Town will be taken over by the Rebel with the highest score.<br><br>
				If CivilWar has town conquering enabled, and the King is the one surrendering, the rebel Town with the highest score will become the new Capital.<br><br>
				For TownWar and NationWar, it is more complicated. The town or nation that wishes to give in must create an offer.<br><br>
				This offer can be for a WhitePeace (nothing,) Money, Towns or Money & Towns combined. See '/surrender ?' for correct command syntax.<br><br>
				The offer is then sent to the mayor or king on the opposite side for their approval. 
				If accepted the war is over and any money or towns is exchanged.<br><br>
				In TownWars, the surrendering Town can only offer itself in surrender, to be merged into the victorious Town.<br><br>
				In NationWars, the surrendering Nation can offer itself or any of its Towns in surrender, to be conquered by the victorious Nation.
			</div>
			<hr>
			<center><h5>Jails and Prisoners of War:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				EventWar makes generous use of the Towny Jail plots, players killed in enemy territory will be transferred to the town's primary jail 
				(falling back to other jails if the primary jail has lost its HP,) to live as a POW (prisoner-of-war.)<br><br>
				In riot wars, players are unjailed if they can leave the jail plot. In other war types they must exit the town's land.<br><br>
				Jailbreaks occur when a jail's HP is dropped to zero and all prisoners are freed.<br><br>
				While jailed, players are unable to score kills, lose their lives or damage townblock HP's.
			</div>	
			<hr>
			<center><h5>End conditions:</h5></center>
			<div style="padding:20px;">
				Wars can be ended by the following conditions:
				<div style="padding:10px;">
					<ul>
